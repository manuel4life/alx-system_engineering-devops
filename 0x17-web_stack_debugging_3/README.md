javascript

exec {'replace':
  provider => shell,
  command  => 'sed -i "s/phpp/php/g" /var/www/html/wp-settings.php'
}

Explanation:

    exec: This Puppet resource type is used to run shell commands.
    provider => shell: Specifies the provider to be used, which is the shell provider in this case.
    command => 'sed -i "s/phpp/php/g" /var/www/html/wp-settings.php': The shell command to be executed. The sed command is used to search and replace the string "phpp" with "php" within the wp-settings.php file. The -i flag is used to edit the file in place, and the file path is /var/www/html/wp-settings.php.
